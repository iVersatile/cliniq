## Phase 0 — OCR Foundation (Weeks 1–2)

**Goal:** Reliable text extraction from any clinical PDF before any LLM work begins.

### Tasks

- [ ] `P0-01` — Verify `pdfplumber` text-layer detection on 5 born-digital sample PDFs
- [ ] `P0-02` — Verify `pytesseract` OCR path on 5 scanned sample PDFs (300 DPI)
- [ ] `P0-03` — Implement `LOW_OCR_CONFIDENCE` flagging (threshold: mean conf < 60)
- [ ] `P0-04` — Implement `HANDWRITTEN_SECTION` detection and marker injection
- [ ] `P0-05` — Build initial test corpus: 5 born-digital + 5 scanned (anonymised via presidio or synthetic via Faker+reportlab)
- [ ] `P0-06` — Write ground-truth JSON for all 10 corpus docs
- [ ] `P0-07` — `tests/test_ingestion.py`: parametrised tests against corpus; assert text non-empty + flag correctness

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `read_pdf()` returns non-empty text for all 5 born-digital corpus PDFs without invoking OCR
- [ ] `read_pdf()` invokes pytesseract for all 5 scanned corpus PDFs and returns non-empty text
- [ ] Pages with mean OCR confidence < 60 carry `LOW_OCR_CONFIDENCE` flag
- [ ] Pages producing no extractable text carry `[HANDWRITTEN — review manually]` marker
- [ ] All 10 corpus PDFs have corresponding ground-truth JSON in `test_corpus/*/ground_truth/`
- [ ] `pytest tests/test_ingestion.py` passes parametrised against all 10 corpus docs with zero failures
- [ ] No corpus PDF causes an unhandled exception

### Definition of Done

- [ ] All task checkboxes in this phase are checked
- [ ] `ruff check`, `ruff format --check`, `mypy` pass with zero errors
- [ ] `pytest --cov-fail-under=80` passes; no regressions vs. previous phase
- [ ] Remote CI green on `main` for all matrix legs (Python 3.11 + 3.12)
- [ ] No PHI, real names, NHS numbers, or API keys in any committed file or CI log
- [ ] `PLAN.md` task checkboxes updated to reflect actual state
- [ ] **Human approval received before phase is marked complete**

## Phase 1 — Prompt Library + JSON Schemas (Weeks 3–4)

**Goal:** Locked extraction contract — prompts + schemas are the stable interface all adapters implement against.

### Tasks

- [ ] `P1-01` — Finalise Pydantic models: `MedicalNote`, `Contact`, `Appointment`, `Medication`, `Symptom`
- [ ] `P1-02` — Write extraction prompt for `medical_note` (outpatient letter template)
- [ ] `P1-03` — Write extraction prompt for `medical_note` (discharge summary template)
- [ ] `P1-04` — Write extraction prompt for `medical_note` (lab report template)
- [ ] `P1-05` — Write extraction prompt for `medication` + `contact` + `appointment`
- [ ] `P1-06` — Test all prompts against Claude API (fastest feedback loop; not the shipping backend)
- [ ] `P1-07` — Add source-sentence citation field to medication + diagnosis extraction
- [ ] `P1-08` — `tests/test_prompts.py`: golden-file tests — run prompt on fixture text, assert schema validates + key fields match ground truth

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All five Pydantic models (`MedicalNote`, `Contact`, `Appointment`, `Medication`, `Symptom`) validate without error on their respective ground-truth JSON fixtures
- [ ] Each schema field has a type annotation and a default or `Field(...)` — no bare `Any`
- [ ] Prompts for outpatient letter, discharge summary, and lab report each return valid `MedicalNote` via Claude API
- [ ] Every medication and diagnosis extraction includes a non-empty `source` sentence verbatim from the input text
- [ ] Golden-file tests (`tests/test_prompts.py`) pass on all prompt families against Claude API
- [ ] A schema breaking change (field rename/removal) requires a version bump — enforced by test

### Definition of Done

- [ ] All task checkboxes in this phase are checked
- [ ] `ruff check`, `ruff format --check`, `mypy` pass with zero errors
- [ ] `pytest --cov-fail-under=80` passes; no regressions vs. previous phase
- [ ] Remote CI green on `main` for all matrix legs (Python 3.11 + 3.12)
- [ ] Schemas declared frozen — no breaking changes without explicit version bump
- [ ] No PHI, real names, NHS numbers, or API keys in any committed file or CI log
- [ ] `PLAN.md` task checkboxes updated to reflect actual state
- [ ] **Human approval received before phase is marked complete**

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `cliniq extract ./test_corpus --output /tmp/out --backend ollama` completes without unhandled exception on all 10 corpus docs
- [ ] Output directory contains `medical_note.json`, `contact.json`, `appointment.json`, `medication.json`, `symptom.json` for each processed PDF
